#Running Club Website

This is the code for the WPI Running Club Website

## Making Website Changes
NOTE: Never make a change in the main branch, there are rules in place to prevent this but still make sure to make changes in a branch.

To update the website, create a new branch called "development". You can then use github.dev to make changes to the html files online, and then save them (commit) to the development branch.

You can also use whatever IDE you want if you're familiar with GitHub

Whenever you commit to the development branch, this website will show the changes made, usually within 10-20 seconds: \
[development--runningclubwebsite.netlify.app](https://development--runningclubwebsite.netlify.app/)\

NOTE: If the branch is not named development, this will not work.

## Publishing Website Changes
To publish website changes onto the main website, first check the development link to ensure everything looks good.

Then, you can create a pull request going from the development branch to the main branch. Make sure to add a title and comment of what changed and then you can accept the pull request and merge. 

NOTE: Once the pull request is merged, the development branch will be deleted automatically. Just repeat the process for any future updates.
